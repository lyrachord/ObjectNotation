# ObjectNotation
The Object Notatin is a base syntax framework which contains a series of application.

# History
The Object Notation inspired by JSON. The biggest movitation is the quote. My thought is, the string contians quote chars, the time loss of one person writing the quote chars is not a problem.Nevertheless, it's a big problem when the whole world write the quote chars. So I tried to advise JSON to remove the quote, but I failed. Indeed ,the removing of quote means that the JSON syntax need to add more kinds of string form.

At the same time, Dan Yodler, I found him at ajaxian.com doing some similar work.

And YAML seems like. YAML is a little bit more complicated, and in the javascript word the jslint is very popular, so YAML-like cannot be linted.

And the W3 CSS seems like.

Another concept in the Object Notation is the nest path, or nest key, f.e. key1: key2: key3: value;

And from the apache's ANT practice, the default value concept is great.

And from OSGi, some http header syntax is great.

So the nest path concept emerges in the Object Notation syntax, which seems like Object world Person.friend.name, or XPath person/friend/name.
